# BOM & Prices

At one point the prices when buying supplies got written down, indended to be
updated when buying the next batch.

All prices are in Euros.


## A Note About Getting 65C02s

When the project was started in mid 2023, 65C02 or 65SC02 were easy to obtain
for ~2,50 Euro per chip when buying 10. However since end of 2024 these chips
are getting harder to get. This results in two things: for one prices rise,
but more importantly there are more fakes around. Two out of three tries to
obtain reasonable priced refurbished 65C02s leads to discovering them being
fakes. This is one of the reasons why the Sorbus is good at detecting the
variant of the 6502 at hand.

The official price at Mouser is ~8.30/chip when buying 10 or more. So, if
prices of refurbished and new old stock rise even more, it makes more
sense to buy new chips.

# Sorbus VGA

The Sorbus VGA is taking the [VGA reference
implementation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras/tree/master/src/common/pico_scanvideo)
of Raspberry Pi's [pico-extras](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras)
and turns this into a VGA card driven by the Sorbus Computer.

So far the theory, the firmware to accomplish this still needs to be written.

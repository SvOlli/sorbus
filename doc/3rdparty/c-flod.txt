C-Flod        version 4.1
2012/05/16
rofl0r

currently done:

- complete flod core
- whittaker player
- future composer
- (ultimate) sound tracker
- pro tracker
- fasttracker 2
- digital mugician
- soundfx
- sidmon 1,2
- bp soundmon
- rob hubbard (only v1)
- "fred editor" player
- jochen hippel and COSO players.
  (there are a few tunes (maybe 3-5 %) that are not working correctly.
   they dont work in uade/original flod either.)
- DeltaMusic 1 & 2
- pseudo barebone flashlib
- libao and wave writer backends.

in my conversion i followed a pretty straight 1:1 approach, 
so that the number of bugs introduced is minimized and future enhancement 
in flod can be backported easily.

i am currently in the process of translating the remaining players.

my goal is to remove any dynamically allocated memory so it could 
be used with a fixed memory usage profile on low end hardware (gba, nds).
since the samples for the fasttracker can be of any size, this needs either
a custom allocator or a pretty huge buffer for each instrument.

the build system should allow to turn off unneeded players and set the size
of buffers manually for the specific need.

also, the code could probably be simplified a lot by removing some of the 
classes and using direct memory writes etc.

This code also contains expansions for this project as well as generic bugs
fixes found in later releases of Microsoft BASIC:

* zero page addresses totally reshuffled, no POKE works as with OSI BASIC
  * e.g. inputbuffer starts at address 25 ($19) instead of 19 ($13) and is
    79 ($4f) instead of 72 ($48) bytes long
  * vector for USR stays the same (11,12) with 10 being the jmp opcode
* line input is handled by kernel instead of BASIC, allowing line editing
* BASIC keywords are case insensitive (both writings can be used)
* BASIC variables are case sensitive (A <> a, both can be used)
* the token of the useless NULL instrution has been replaced by SYS
  * sys0 calls the machine language monitor
  * addresses 13,14,15 will be used to shadow A,X,Y registers
  * rest of tokens are unchanged, so most of the code for OSI BASIC should
    work on the Sorbus Computer as well
* address 9 can be used to select charset in list output
  * POKE 9,PEEK(9)AND223 switches to upper case output
  * POKE 9,PEEK(9)OR32 switches to lower case output
  * this only changes the tokens, not variable names
* LOAD and SAVE are adapted to use internal drive
  * LOAD"$" shows directory _without_ losing BASIC programm
  * loading a file not used returns an "NF error"
    (reusing "no for" as "not found")
* memory used for BASIC is $0400-$CFFF (=52K)
* FRE(0) fixed
* POKE a, PEEK(b) fixed

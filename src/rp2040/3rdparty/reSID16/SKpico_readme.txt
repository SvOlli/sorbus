This directory contains a modified version of reSID 0.16 (with parts from reSID 1.0) by Dag Lem.

There are modifications at several locations, e.g. LUTs, waveforms/voices, enforcing outputs of digi techniques, creating outputs for RGB LEDs etc. 

I strongly recommend to not work from this version when using reSID in other projects. 

If the emulation is not working as intended it is probably because of the SKpico-modifications. Please refer to the unmodified reSID 0.16 and 1.0 source code.

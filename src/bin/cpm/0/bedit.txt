BEdit
=====

BEdit is an incredibly simple line editor themed after a Basic interpreter. It
has almost no features, but can be used to edit text files. With this and the
assembler, you have a full software development kit!

Usage
-----

```
BEDIT [<filename>]
```

Once started, you'll get a `>` prompt, at which you can use the traditional
BASIC commands LIST, NEW, SAVE, LOAD, RENUMBER and of course line entry. These
should work pretty much how you expect. Non-standard commands are:

  - FREE: displays the amount of free memory
  - DELETE <line or line range>: deletes one or multiple lines
  - QUIT: returns to CP/M

Be careful of DELETE: if you use it with no parameters, it'll delete your
entire document.

Things which may surprise you:

  - Lines can be empty (unlike in BASIC). Just typing in a line number will
	make an empty line. Use DELETE to remove lines.

  - Pressing a key during LIST will stop the listing.

  - Files are always CP/M format, i.e. CRLF terminated with a ^Z at the end.

  - All commands can be abbreviated with a dot. So, RENUM. is equivalent to
	RENUMBER. So is R.. A . by itself is equivalent to LIST.

  - There is no ability to edit within a line (yet). Just retype the entire
	line...

The source code for BEDIT is intended to be assembled with the built-in
assembler. You'll need about 40kB of TPA to load it and about 30kB to assemble
it.
